# ShingodTTS
Based on Text-to-Speech for Arduino by jscrane.

My robot needs a voice, and this is my choice.

Just adding wrapper functions to handle some of the words and phrases to be pronounced in a way that I'd like.

Working on adding vocabulary for both English and Japanese.

Interestingly, it turns out that Japanese is much easier to produce the desired pronunciation as compared to English.


Original code as placeholder for now.
I am to extract this part of the code from my current project before uploading as a standalone thing.
The sorted code is to be uploaded by mid January 2021.


- Started on English vocabulary.
- Started on Japanese vocabulary.
- Addition of UTF-8 Japanese language hiragana input to speech mapping of individual letters complete.


Leaving this here as a reminder for me to share my work.
